# Studio - Flutter

## Introduction
Today, you will be introduced to mobile app design through building a simple bakery list app! We will leverage a powerful cross-platform framework called Flutter to build an app that can run on the web, your phone, or a native program on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Introduction Activity
Discuss with your group:
- As a UX designer, what differences have you seen in mobile app designs versus web designs?
- What are some design aspects you would consider before designing a mobile app for a client?

## Environment Setup
We will be using flutlab.io, an online Flutter IDE. Using this online environment should help alleviate common issues students may encounter while installing a Flutter development environment locally.

* Visit flutlab.io, and sign in with your Brown Google account.
* Once you sign in, you’ll be taken to your personal dashboard.
* Click the `+ Project` button in the top right corner to create a new project.
* Under *Choose codebase*, select **Code Base #1: Stateless Hello World**
* For *Project name*, name your project whatever you’d like - perhaps something like `bakery`.
* Leave *Package* blank
* Your project will show up in the dashboard. Click it to access the codebase and the online IDE.

You should now see something like this:
